# Introduction
mapping-extensions extends dictionaries, incorporating decorators to help assign functions and classes to Hashable keys. The library also provides variations to this base concept, including:

`mapext.descriptorregister` module: Allowing for dynamic extension of class functionality dependent on input.

mapping-extensions also features a `FrozenKeys` class, a dictionary that is immutable once a particular key has been assigned a value.
